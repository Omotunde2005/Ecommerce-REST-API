<h1>About Project</h1>

<p>This is a simple REST API built with Django-rest-framework in Python. It imitates an ecommerce web API where
users can get their products as well as the sales on each product.

Similarly, they can also edit or delete these products via the API.

Also, users can get other products and stores provided they know their URL, that is a unique combination of 6
english alphabets.

The API uses mixins, serializers, rate-limiting, token authentication, etc. to provide more functionality to the API.

Finally, each endpoint in the API can only be accessed by authenticated users.</p>
